""" Dictionary class

This module creates the base ldt dictionary class that is inherited by
classes for individual resources. It stores the global variables that are
either set by the user or read from the config.py file in the user's home
directory.

Basic functionality required in any subclass:

    * checking if the queried word has an entry in the resource;
    * retrieve the list of word with the specified relation;
    * retrieve a dictionary with specified relations as values and lists of
      related words as values

Todo:
    * creation of default config file upon installation
    * the right error path in NLTK tokenizer
    * add .citation property, and print it out on initialization
        WordNet 1.5, NLTK implementation. Use .citation to get the full
        citation for this resource.
