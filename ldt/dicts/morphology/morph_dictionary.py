""" Morphological Dictionary class

This module implements the base Morphological dictionary class that is
inherited by classes for resources from which morphological information can be
obtained.

Basic functionality required in any subclass:

    * retrieving POS information of an entry;
    * lemmatization;
    * retrieving morphological form codes

Todo:
    * creation of default config file upon installation
    * the right error path in NLTK tokenizer
    * generating inflected forms with  https://github.com/jazzband/inflect
