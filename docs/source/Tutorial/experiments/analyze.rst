===================================
Analysing the results of annotation
===================================

----------------
Input and output
----------------

The input to this step of analysis is the annotated vector neighborhoods, generated
as described in section :ref:`Annotating vector neighborhoods`.

The basic usage is as follows:

>>> experiment = ldt.experiments.LDScoring(experiment_name="just testing", ld_scores=["Synonyms", "Antonyms"], overwrite=True)
>>> experiment.get_results()

This will produce two files in `experiments/just_testing` subfolder
of your ldt data folder: `ld_scores.tsv` file and `metadata.json`.

Sample scoring file format:

+--------------------+----------+----------+
| Embedding          | Synonyms | Antonyms |
+--------------------+----------+----------+
| sample_embeddings  | 0.0      | 0.49     |
+--------------------+----------+----------+
| sample_embeddings2 | 0.35     | 0.0      |
+--------------------+----------+----------+

Metadata file includes and partly copies the annotation metadata in the "annotation" key.
(see :ref:`Annotating vector neighborhoods`).
It also adds the output ld_scores (as some of them are derived from annotations
in a non-trivial way).

Supported ld scores
-------------------

All ld scores described in the paper are supported, and the list is growing.
ld_scores argument of :class:`~ldt.experiments.analyze.LDScoring` takes a list of
any of the following scores (or `"all"` for all possible scores). Obviously, the
relevant information must have been annotated in the previous stage of the experiment.

- "SharedPOS",
- "SharedMorphForm",
- "SharedDerivation",
- "NonCooccurring",
- "CloseNeighbors",
- "FarNeighbors",
- "LowFreqNeighbors",
- 'HighFreqNeighbors',
- "GDeps",
- "TargetFrequency",
- "NeighborFrequency",
- "Associations",
- "ShortestPathMedian",
- "CloseInOntology",
- "Synonyms",
- "Antonyms",
- "Meronyms",
- "Hyponyms",
- "Hypernyms",
- "OtherRelations",
- "Numbers",
- "ProperNouns",
- "Misspellings",
- "URLs",
- "Filenames",
- "ForeignWords",
- "Hashtags",
- "Noise".

See `this page <http://ldtoolkit.space/ldscores/>`_ for more details on ld scores.

--------------------------
How LD scores are computed
--------------------------

Binary relations (e.g. synonymy is either detected or not) are quantified as a
simple count of all cases of that relation in all target:neighbor pairs for each
embedding. Directed lexicographic relations (hypernymy, hyponymy, meronymy) are
counted when the target word is e.g. a hypernym of the neighbor.

Continuous variables are broken down into bins, the size of which was chosen
empirically. The :meth:`~ldt.experiments.analyze.LDScoring._process` method
provides settings for:

- *lowfreq_threshold*: neighbors below this number will be considered low-frequency,
  and those above this number - high-frequency (default: 1000).
- *far_neighbors_threshold*: neighbors further than this number will be considered
  as "far neighbors" (default: 0.7).
- close_neighbors_threshold (float): neighbors closer than this number will be
  considered as "close neighbors" (default: 0.8).
- *ontology_threshold* (float): neighbors closer in ontology than this number will
  be considered "CloseInOntology".
