Corpus-specific resources
=========================

It is possible to use LDT as simply another dictionary resource. However, if you are interested in LDT as a tool for
exploring and profiling word embeddings, comparing models will only be fair if they started from the same raw corpus.
To this end, we are sharing the data that we used in our experiments. `Get in touch <http://www.cs.uml.edu/~arogers/>`_
if you'd like to make your data available here in the same way.
