Welcome to LDT documentation!
=============================

LDT is an open-source Python library for qualitative/quantitative *intrinsic
evaluation of word embeddings*. It can tell you what linguistic relations
your fancy algorithm picks up.

LDT can also be used in other NLP tasks that rely on *relation
classification*. In addition to WordNet, it provides a combined interface
for querying Wiktionary, Wikisaurus, and BabelNet.  With these resoures, LDT
can handle a wide range of morphological and semantic relations between
words, even with noisy input.
