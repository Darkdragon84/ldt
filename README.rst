**TLDR**: LDT is a shiny new Python library for doing two things:

* querying lots of dictionaries from a unified interface:
  **spelling normalization, lemmatization, morphological analysis, WordNet,
  Wiktionary, BabelNet, and a lot more**.

* using the above to **explore and profile word embeddings**, i.e. the cool
  distributional representations of words as vectors. If you have never
  heard the word "word2vec", you're missing out, and here's `an introduction
  <https://www.shanelynn.ie/get-busy-with-word-embeddings-introduction/>`_.
  If you have, head  over to the `project website <ldtoolkit.space>`_ for
  some new research results. If you don't care about word embeddings, you
  can just use LDT as a supplement to NLTK, SpaCy, and other great NLP tools.

Current functionality:

* A unified interface for querying a vast array of resources for natural
  language processing, including Wiktionary, BabelNet, WordNet, and a lot of
  new custom routines:

     * misspellings (*cat : kat*);
     * inflected forms (*cat : cats*);
     * derivational relations (*cat : catness*);
     * lexicographic semantic relations:
       - synonymy (*cat : pussycat*);
       - antonymy (*black : white*);
       - hyperonymy (*cat : feline*);
       - hyponymy (*feline : cat*);
       - co-hyponymy (*cat : dog*);
       - meronymy (*cat : tail*)
     * psychological association norms (cat : mouse)
     * corpus-based statistics (e.g. for *cat : mouse* pair the frequency of
       *mouse* in the corpus in general and in the context of *cat* in
       particular);

* Using the above for large-scale analysis of potential relations between pairs
  of words

* Full setup for experimenting with your favorite word embeddings: loading
  them, drawing balanced vocab samples, and profiling them for the kinds of
  information that they encode.

That last step can help you predict how your model will do on a particular
task, and also give some ideas about how it can be improved. Check out the
`results of a large-scale experiment with 60 embeddings and 21 datasets.

Yes, LDT is multilingual! At least, as far as querying semantic relations
goes. LDT supports the largest free multilingual resources (Wiktionary
and BabelNet), so everything they have is retrievable. However, many of the
other LDT modules are language-specific, and only English is fully supported at
the moment. But the infrastructure for adding other languages is already
in place, so if you can find or create e.g. lists of affixes for your
language, development would be easy. Get in touch if you'd like to get
involved.
